# Natural_Language_Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), and linguistics. It focuses on the interaction between computers and human language, particularly how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. 

The ultimate objective of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. NLP represents a significant step in making human-computer interactions more natural and intuitive, with wide-ranging applications and ongoing developments.

NLP involves understanding human language, including grammar, context, and idioms. This requires parsing sentences, recognizing speech patterns, and understanding different languages and dialects. Developing models that predict the likelihood of a sequence of words helps in tasks like auto-completion and correcting grammar or spelling in text editors. 

NLP is a rapidly evolving field, with ongoing research and development pushing the boundaries of what's possible in human-computer interactions.

### NLP uses:

- Sentiment Analysis: This involves analyzing text to determine the sentiment behind it, such as determining if a review is positive, negative, or neutral.

- Machine Translation: NLP enables the translation of text or speech from one language to another, aiming for both accuracy and fluency.

- Text Classification: NLP is used to assign discrete label out of a finite set of labels to a given text. Ex. Spam or not spam(ham)

- Speech Recognition: A part of NLP involves the conversion of spoken language into text, which is used in voice-activated systems and dictation software.
  
- Text-to-Speech: The opposite of speech recognition, this involves converting text into spoken voice output, used in applications like GPS navigation systems and reading assistants.

- Information Extraction: NLP is used to identify and extract key pieces of information from large volumes of text, such as names, places, dates, and specific facts.

- Text Summarization: Creating concise summaries of large texts or documents is another application of NLP.

- Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: NLP is integral in developing interactive and responsive chatbots and virtual assistants that can engage in natural-sounding conversations with users.

- Deep Learning and NLP: The integration of deep learning techniques has significantly advanced the capabilities of NLP, enabling more sophisticated understanding and generation of human language.

### NLP Common Terms:

- Tokenization: This is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens. Tokens can be words, numbers, or punctuation marks. Tokenization is often the first step in NLP pipelines, preparing text for more complex processing.

- Stemming: Stemming is the process of reducing words to their word stem or root form. For instance, the words "fishing", "fished", and "fisher" all stem to the word "fish". This helps in normalizing words for text processing tasks, but the stems might not always be actual dictionary words.

- Tagging: In NLP, tagging typically refers to Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, which is the process of labeling each word in a sentence with its appropriate part of speech (like noun, verb, adjective, etc.). This is crucial for understanding the grammatical structure of sentences.

- Parsing: Parsing involves analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence, identifying its constituents, and how these constituents relate to each other. It helps in understanding the sentence's syntax and is essential for more complex NLP tasks.

- Semantic Reasoning: This is the process of understanding the meaning and context of a sentence beyond its syntactic structure. It involves interpreting the underlying meanings, intentions, or sentiments of the words or sentences, and how these meanings change in different contexts.

- Part-of-Speech Tagging: This is a process of assigning parts of speech to individual words in a text (like verbs, nouns, adjectives, etc.). It's a fundamental step in text analysis and helps in understanding the syntax of the language.

- Named Entity Recognition (NER): NER is the process of identifying and classifying named entities (like people, organizations, locations, dates, products, etc.) present in a text. This is important for extracting information from text and is widely used in information retrieval, question answering systems, and data mining.

- Syntactic Dependency Parsing: This involves analyzing the syntactic structure of a sentence by establishing relationships between “head” words and words which modify those heads. It helps in understanding how different words in a sentence relate to each other, and is essential for detailed linguistic analysis of text.

### Bag-Of-Words:

The "Bag of Words" (BoW) model is a simple and commonly used way in natural language processing to represent text data. In this model, a text (such as a sentence or a document) is represented as the bag (multiset) of its words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping multiplicity. The Bag of Words model is powerful due to its simplicity and efficiency in converting text into numerical data, which can then be used for various computational processes like classification or clustering in machine learning. However, it has limitations such as not capturing the order of words and the context they are used in.

##### Summary of the Bag of Words model with an Example:

"The cat sat on the mat."
"The dog sat on the log."

1. List Unique Words: It starts by identifying all the unique words in the text. -> the, cat, sat, on, mat, dog, log

2. Create a Vector: For each unique word, create a vector with a place for every unique word. The length of this vector is equal to the number of unique words.

3. Count the Words: In the vector, count how many times each word appears in the text. This count is placed in the corresponding position in the vector.

"The cat sat on the mat" becomes [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
"The dog sat on the log" becomes [2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]
Here, the first and third to sixth positions in the vector represent the words 'the', 'sat', 'on', 'mat', 'dog', and 'log', respectively. The count of each of these words in the sentences is reflected in the vector.
